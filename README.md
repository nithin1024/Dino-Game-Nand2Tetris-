# Dino-Game-Nand2Tetris

This repository contains the implementation of a simple "Dino Game" developed for the Nand2Tetris platform. The project consists of various modules written in Jack and VM languages, designed to simulate the classic dino-running game on a basic computer architecture.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **cactus.jack / cactus.vm**: Contains the logic for the cacti obstacles in the game. It defines how the cactus objects are created, moved, and detected for collisions.
- **Dino.jack / Dino.vm**: Defines the behavior of the Dino character, including jumping and running mechanics.
- **Dinogame.jack / Dinogame.vm**: Manages the overall game logic, integrating the Dino character, obstacles, and game over conditions.
- **Main.jack / Main.vm**: The entry point of the game. It handles initialization, game loop, and manages interactions between the player and obstacles.
- **utility.jack / Utility.vm**: Contains utility functions and helpers used across the project for game mechanics, such as random number generation or score tracking.

## How to Run

To run the game, you'll need the Nand2Tetris platform (version X.X or later). Follow these steps:

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Dino-Game-Nand2Tetris.git
   ```

2. Open the Nand2Tetris platform and load the relevant `.vm` files.
   
3. Compile the Jack files if necessary, using the Nand2Tetris Jack Compiler.

4. Run the `Main.vm` file as the entry point for the game.

5. Enjoy the game! Control the Dino character to avoid the cacti obstacles.

## Dependencies

- Nand2Tetris platform: [Official Website](https://www.nand2tetris.org)
- Jack Compiler (included in Nand2Tetris)

## Future Enhancements

- Implement sound effects and scoring.
- Improve the collision detection mechanism.
- Add difficulty levels and more complex obstacle patterns.
